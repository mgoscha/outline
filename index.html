  <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
      As an image-maker in such an image-saturated world, I am in a unique position to<br>
      reflect on the very action of image making and also to evaluate in my artwork the<br>
      significance of the photograph as an artistic medium. I want to create photographs<br>
      that reflect my situation as a Millennial who is simultaneously observing, participating<br>
      in and creating the culture around him. I have grown up and matured in a time when social<br>
      networks catalogue every moment of my very growth, and so with my generation I am immersed<br>
      more than anyone before in the ubiquity of the photographic image. With my work I intend to give a<br>
      culturally, racially, politically and historically transcending voice to the artistic ambiguities<br>
      that arise from social networking and information sharing, specifically concerning ideas<br>
      of self-identity in the western world and how the process of shaping the notion of self<br>
      compares with more distant cultures and societies. Expression through personal image speaks<br>
      volumes about an individual, especially an artist, and by deliberately exploring this expression<br>
      through the process of image making, I can begin to reconcile with the complexities of identity<br>
      in the 21st century.

    <p>
      I am a Kansas City native studying Photography &amp; Imaging at Ringling College of Art &amp; Design<br>
      and currently pursuing a 1 year certificate in the General Studies Program at the International Center of<br>
      Photography. I was previously an editorial photography intern at Mashable in New York City. I am an avid<br>
      runner and unabashed tech geekwho spends too much time reading 20th century Russian literature and watching<br>
      Vine comiplations.
